# It takes 21 seconds to wash your hands 
# and help prevent the spread of COVID-19.
#
# Create a function that takes the number of times 
# a person washes their hands per day (n) 
# and the number of months (m) they follow this routine, 
# and calculates the duration in minutes and seconds 
# that person spends washing their hands.
#
# Examples:
# wash_hands(8, 7) ➞ "588 minutes and 0 seconds"
# wash_hands(0, 0) ➞ "0 minutes and 0 seconds"
# wash_hands(7, 9) ➞ "661 minutes and 30 seconds"
# 
# Notes: Consider a month has 30 days.
